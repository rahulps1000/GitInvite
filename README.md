**Prerequisites**

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version 14.x or higher)
- Git
- A GitHub account with developer access

**Steps to Deploy Locally**

#### 1. Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/rahulps1000/gitinvite.git
```

#### 2. Go to the project directory

  cd gitinvite
```

#### 3. Install Dependencies:

After navigating to the project directory, run the following command to install all the necessary dependencies:

```

#### 4. Set Up Environment Variables:

You need to configure the environment variables for GitHub OAuth. An example configuration is available in the `.env.example` file. Copy this file and update the values:

```bash
  cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit .env.local with your own values:

```bash
  GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_github_client_id
  GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_github_client_secret
  NEXTAUTH_SECRET=next_auth_secret_key
  NEXTAUTH_URL=next_auth_url

You can obtain the GITHUB_CLIENT_ID and GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET by registering a new OAuth application in your GitHub account.

#### 4. Run the Application:

Start the development server:

```bash
  npm run dev
```

#### 5. Access the Application:
